/**
 * Offline evaluation of The Algorithm against ground truth: the viewer's own

 * went on to like, and diagnoses why each miss was buried.
 *
 * Usage: npx tsx scripts/eval.ts <did-or-handle> [windowHours=24]
 *
 * Caveat: scores use engagement counts as of eval time, not as of the moment
 * the feed would have served the post. Fresh-post misses are judged slightly
 * unfairly; treat trends across runs as the signal, not single numbers.
